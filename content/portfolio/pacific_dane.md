#### Project Requirements

Use colors suitable to night mode themes, keep it simple, and design a custom logo.


#### Project Details

Client requested a website design for their great dane breeding business. They requested that the main color be dark. I found out that they liked teal colors as well and put the two together, they were very pleased with the color scheme. I reviewed every great dane breeder’s website that I could find to figure out what information was typical, and to get a feel for the competition. My client wanted to have as few pages as possible, so the home page was designed to contain most of the information, with the rest being linked through CTA’s. 

Website designed in Adobe XD, logo made in Illustrator
