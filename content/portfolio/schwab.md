#### Project Requirements

Design custom graphic, must be usable as a car magnet to go on the side of a truck, make it stand out


#### Project Details

I started by designing different logo ideas, the client mentioned that he thought it would be nice to have it look like a truck. I drafted up three different ideas and presented them to the client, he really liked one in particular so I started designing the car magnet he wanted using it. I made several color variations of the design and let the client choose which he liked best. He loved the bright orange. He told me where he was getting the car magnet printed and I looked up what dimensions they had, what format the file should be in, and any other printing instructions to make sure that the file was ready for print.

Made in Adobe Illustrator.
